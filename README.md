# Code-it hello world API
The most overcomplicated hello world API  
  
The server first converts the hello world string to brainfuck, then it maps the bytes into a Float32Array to perform Fourier Transform to generate a frequency domain of the input, and returns the output through "/hello-world" endpoint with JSON format.  
The client then decode the received response like peeling the onion skin.
